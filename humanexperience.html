      <h1>Human Experience</h1>
      <p>Human experience consists of our subjective reality: emotions, feelings, thoughts, memories, attention, perception. The closer we can get to what makes each human experience unique, the more we are able to empathize with them, and the better our service, product and interaction can become.</p>
      <p>Advancement of technologies for measuring biosignals has opened up new opportunities for investigating human experiences. We at The NEMO Project apply the latest scientific knowledge in the measurement of human experience, while realizing the limitations of the current state of the art.</p>
